I am Haodi Wang, a Master of Science student at Southeast University and major in Software Engineering . I have solid programming skills in Python/Java/C++ and comprehensive knowledge on various computer science fields including machine learning, deep learning, data mining, database, system, and website programming. With several internship experiences in the industry, I have enhanced my ability on developing software products related to machine learning, database, and website.  I increased my capacity on more advanced computer science topics such as graph neural networks and reinforcement learning . Carrying much passion, I want to solve more computer science related issues, build more useful libraries, and produce more influential software products in the future.
